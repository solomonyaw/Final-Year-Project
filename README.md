# Final-Year-Project
A social protection management Information System

This repository contains the documentation of my Final year project which involved a research work to develop develop a social protection management information
system to register potential members online to make contributions into social security schemes and to provide social assistance to beneficiaries of the scheme via a
secure web portal. This thesis was based on a case study into how the social security system works in a developing country such as Ghana.
